        "For this assignment you will use PyTorch instead of EDF to implement and train neural networks. The experiments in this assignment will take a long time to run without a GPU, but you can run the notebook remotely on Google Colab and have access to GPUs for free -- in this case you don't have to worry about installing PyTorch as it is available by default in Google Colab's environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In case you will be running the experiments in your own machine, you should install PyTorch -- there are multiple tutorials online and it is especially easy if you're using Anaconda. Check https://pytorch.org/tutorials/ for some PyTorch tutorials -- this assignment assumes that you know the basics like defining models with multiple modules and coding up functions to train models with PyTorch optimizers. To \n",

        "To use Google Colab, you should access https://colab.research.google.com/ and upload this notebook to your workspace. To use a GPU, go to Edit -> Notebook settings and select GPU as the accelerator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike previous assignments, in this one you will have to do some writing instead of just coding. Try to keep your answers short and precise, and you are encouraged to write equations if needed (you can do that using markdown cells). You can also use code as part of your answers (like plotting and printing, etc). Blue text indicates questions or things that you should discuss/comment, and there will red \"ANSWER (BEGIN)\" and \"ANSWER (END)\" markdown cells to indicate that you should add cells with your writeup between these two. **Make sure not to redefine variables or functions in your writeup, which can change the behavior of the next cells.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, you might have to do minor changes to the provided code due to differences in python/pytorch versions. You can post on piazza if there's a major, non-trivial change that you had to do (so other students can be aware of it and how to proceed), but for minor changes you should just apply them and keep working on the assignment."

        "In the second experiment, we changed the learning rate to 0.001. The model did a little better and could train a model with up to 87 convolutional layers. This improvement was achieved by changing the initialization code for the parameters of the model. More concretely, initializing our parameters by sampling from a gaussian distribution with a sigma as defined above can make our model’s parameters more stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The CNNelu model, which is exactly the same as described above but using ELU activation functions instead of tanh, didn’t perform as well. In this experiment, the model was able to train up to 42 convolutional layers using a learning rate of 0.001, which is an important downgrade with respect to the last experiment. This can be explained because in deep networks without batchnorm, when using ELU activation function the inputs and gradients of the parameters in each layer can get really high values as there is no upper bound for this activation function as there is one for the tanh, therefore the trainability was worse.\n",
        "\n",
        "With the introduction of batch normalization, the next experiment performed substantially better. It could be trained using up to 126 convolutional layers using a learning rate of 0.001, which is a great improvement from our last best  model, which allowed 87. The normalization layer after each convolution whitenned the data. Each layer has an input that is variant to the past layers. Using batch normalization makes the network less sensitive to changes in its inputs by forcing them to be mean 0 and variance 1. The network is more stable even when the inputs’ distributions are different. This is also known as internal covariance shift.\n",

        "The big change however,  is introduced by the ResNet model, which implements residual connections. From the experiments we saw that it could train more than 800 convolutional layers with a learning rate of 0.001,  which is an abrupt improvement in comparison with the other models. We are adding directly information about past layers. Therefore, during backward propagation the network is able to better distribute the gradients to the layers below and is able to achieve a great improvement in the trainability of deep networks.\n",

The batchnorm layer kind of works as a stablizer for the model parameters, which is the same as we were looking for with the new init model. Therefore, using batchnorm we are already using parameters that are good for the model and the new init should make no difference. That is, if we use batchnorm, it doesn't matter which of the initialization techniques we use. However, CNNtanhBN_oldinit outperforms CNNtanh_newinit because we are 'stablizing' the model after each epoch, and not only in at the beggining. In general terms, the best model was CNNtanhBN_oldinit followed by CNNtanh_newinit and CNNtanh. They models could be trained with up to 96, 84 and 9 convolutional layers respectively."
